title: Platform for Integrated Governance in Chennai
intended: Urban Planners, Policy Makers, Academia, Civil society groups
keywords: Urban systems, Simulations, Land Use, Water, Waste
intro: The story of most Indian cities is similar — on the one hand is rapid development and growth, and on the other scarce resources under extreme pressure, both from internal demand and environmental changes.
description: <p class="simple-content">In Chennai, these challenges were evident after the deluge in November-December 2015, the cyclone in December 2016, and the drought of 2017.</p><p class="simple-content">How can more integrated and actionable strategies be developed to meet these interconnected challenges? How can we create a platform for different stakeholders to come together to plan for a resilient future in a participatory manner? These are the questions we pursue in the project ‘A Platform Integrated Urban Governance in Metropolitan Chennai&#58; Developing Resilience Scenarios and Strategies Through Simulation and Gaming’. We propose to create a simulation-based tool that allows for testing future scenarios to create a more resilient future for Chennai.</p><p class="simple-content">The project is a collaboration between Fields of View; Tamil Nadu State Land Use Board, Government of Tamil Nadu; Center for Urbanization, Buildings & Environment (CUBE) at IIT-Madras; and Okapi Research. Our efforts in this project are supported by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.
