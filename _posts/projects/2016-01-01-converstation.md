intro: To increase reporting of sexual harassment of women in public spaces, and ensure institutional linkages for the data to be used.
description: <p class="simple-content">While newspapers debate over women's safety, can we think of designing options to enhance a sense of safety of women in public spaces, without compromising their freedom?<p/><p class="simple-content">It is this question we explored in a cross-cultural design collaboration between two teams, one in Bangalore and the other in Amsterdam, comprising students of both Indian and Dutch nationalities. The focus of the team in Bangalore was to address under-reporting of sexual harassment of women in public spaces.</p><p class="simple-content">Outputs include prototype of an electronic panel, Convers[t]ation, for informally reporting cases of sexual harassment; and a white paper on the institutional support required for the panel.<p/>
collaborations: The project was a collaboration between mediaLAB Amsterdam, IIIT-B, and Fields of View
