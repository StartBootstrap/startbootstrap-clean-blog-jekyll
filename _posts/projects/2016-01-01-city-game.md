intro: The City Game is designed to explore urban form and elicit a group/individual's preferences about their city.
description: <p class="simple-content">Participants play in turns and react to each others' actions, and in doing so create a dynamic that is absent in traditional participation/feedback processes. The game allows for experiments with various design alternatives. Players can experiment with different policies and rules, observe various patterns that emerge and contrast different emerging scenarios.</p><p class="simple-content">In the game, participants take turns to build their city and witness the evolution of the city visually in real-time. We have multiple variants of the City Game. In one of the variants, the participants are given one simple rule - they have to inform the rest of the group, what they are building.</p>
