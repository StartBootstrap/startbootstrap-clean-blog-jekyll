You might have seen [Popsugar's 2015 Reading Challenge](http://www.popsugar.com/love/Reading-Challenge-2015-36071458) -
I have had friends send it to me a couple of times. The checklist of books to read in 2015 actually looks interesting and
diverse enough to be worth considering, but the 7x30 image format they provided it in isn't really convenient to use.

So if you want to do the reading challenge this year, let me give you a [google docs spreadsheet](http://goo.gl/SJEP4J) to track your progress
at a glance. The categories automagically turn green as you complete the checklist - all you need to do is copy the
spreadsheet to your own account or download it for offline use and fill it in as you go along - I probably will too.
