<h3>Hi Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>After an intensive one month onboarding process in Toronto with Code For Canada (C4C) staff and various industry leaders, we have finally settled into Ottawa. An air of excitement and curiosity fills the building as we slowly make our way around the office to meet our new colleagues. It is immediately apparent that everyone is eager and supportive of a "Digital First" mindset and we couldn't be happier to be in such a positive environment! </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">What a great looking team!</span>

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Code For Canada, we are a team of digital experts who have been partnered with Measurement Canada to deliver on two key objectives:</p>

<p></p>

<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>Build a digital solution that will help solve a challenge experienced by Measurement Canada</li>
  <li>Build digital capacity within Measurement Canada</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>In the upcoming weeks, we will be quickly orienting ourselves to become more embedded into the organization, meeting all stakeholders and to quickly understand where and how we can add value to our partners. </p>

<p>If you would like to learn more, head on over to our <a href="https://pixel-gram.github.io/pixel-gram.github.io/about">About Us</a> page or drop by our office on the second floor, room 274. We’re excited to meet and to work with everyone!</p>
