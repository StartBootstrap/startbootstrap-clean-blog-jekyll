<p>Here is some basic facts about me! I am going to be a senior at a boarding school in Watertown, Connecticut called Taft School but I live just outside of San Francisco, California. I have a younger brother and sister named Oliver and Ella who also are in high school and go to boarding school. At Taft I am the captian of the Varsity Ski team and the starting goalie on the Varsity Lacrosse team. I also play JV Field Hockey on my off season for fun. When I am home I love to surf, hike and mountain bike. I spend my summers up in Michigan where I love to just be on the water ans wakesurf.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
