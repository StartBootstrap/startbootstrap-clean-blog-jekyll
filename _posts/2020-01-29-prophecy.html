<p>Hello! I'm Harley, a writing and speaking tutor at Texas A&M’s University Writing Center and a student writing coordinator at Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Before becoming a technical communication professional, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Journalism with minors in Mathematics and Technology Management.</p>

<p>Today's blog is about how I came to be where I am careerwise.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How I Chose My Career Path</h2>

<p>I am always looking for ways to grow and improve my knowledge. However, I felt like I hadn’t learned enough, having new information presented to me but never grasping why I need to know it. I like knowing a little bit about every subject, but in college you need a major (or two if you really feel like it).</p>

<p>So I was torn. I love writing, collecting journals because “I may have use for them eventually” and making lists for every little thing (like a list of tasks I want to complete in a day). I also love editing, catching those ever-so-small mistakes in newspapers or ads. I was a copy editor in high school and competed in journalism competitions, so journalism was close to my heart. Let’s not forget reading too. For as long as I can remember, I have loved books, buying all that I can to have my own personal library. When it came time to get a first job, my parents said I couldn’t get one at a bookstore… we all knew I’d spend my paycheck there.</p>

<p>Yet I also adored math. Every problem was a puzzle to me, just like sudoku. While I struggled with science topics, math was my reliable buddy. Some problems frustrate me to no end, but finally getting the answer is one of the best feelings. I grew up wanting to be an accountant but eventually landed on engineering. Still I never felt confident completely in pursuing engineering because I didn’t have very much experience like I did with writing and reading.</p>

<p>How could I choose between something in liberal arts and something in STEM? Then I learned about technical communication. I could write (or code but nevertheless write), and I could choose what field to write in.</p>

<p>My love for journalism, mathematics, and technology will make me a great technical communicator. From journalism, I have learned how to talk to strangers effortlessly, ask important questions, and write effectively on a deadline. From mathematics, I have learned to never give up on solving problems, whether by hand or through coding. From technology, I am learning the basic knowledge to understand the technology industry.</p>

<p>STEM industries need technical communicators and what better than a technical communicator who knows your industry.</p>
