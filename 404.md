It seems like the page you wanted to visit isn't there. It's probably my fault - I recently migrated the blog from
[almost-done.net](http://almost-done.net/) domain to github.io and some parts might have gotten lost along the way.

Please head for the [main page]({{ site.url }}) and look for stuff from there. All the information that was on the old
site should still be here.
