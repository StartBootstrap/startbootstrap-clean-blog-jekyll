My name is Jacek Królikowski, I'm a programmer from Warsaw, Poland. In 2014 I have graduated from the University
of Warsaw and moved to London to work for Skype. I now do backend engineering at an amazing startup called
[Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/).

In my spare time I do some more coding, climb at [The Arch](http://www.archclimbingwall.com/#intro) or cycle around London.

 in the address with a ".") or try an appropriate link from the footer ;)
