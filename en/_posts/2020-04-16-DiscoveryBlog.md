<h3>Hey Measurement Canada!</h3>

<p>
We hope you are all doing well and staying safe in this unprecedented time. We’re excited to give you another update about our project and what we’ve been up to so far.
</p>

<p>
In the past two months, we have been focusing on gaining a better understanding of the challenges that Measurement Canada employees facing on a regular basis. 
We spoke with over twenty employees of various different positions, seniority levels, disciplines and regions to better understand the pain points they experience.
We summarized and consolidated similar problems, and conducted an environmental scan to determine whether other initiatives are being pursued outside of the 
fellowship that could help to solve these problems. This helped us to get an idea of potential blockers and enablers associated with the different problem areas. 
While completion of this phase took a significant amount of time, it was an important step to help us find the solution with the most value to Measurement Canada employees.
</p>

<p>To help us decide which direction to take, we asked ourselves some key questions: 
  <ol class="pg-list">
    <li>
      What is the initial cause of the problem? 
    </li>
     <li>
      Is it something that could be solved through technology or does it require a change of policy or regulatory processes? 
    </li>
    <li>
      How many people does the problem affect?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is it within our capacity to solve it?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can we deliver a solution in the next six to seven months to help employees affected by the problem?
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
 
<p>
  To help guide our decision-making, we answered these questions using a three-star ranking system (the more stars, the better). From this, we were able to determine that we could deliver the most value by focusing on the pain points of electricity and gas, and weights and measures inspectors. 
</p>
 
<p>
  More specifically, we decided to focus on the pain points of planning and coordinating inspections. We summarized these paint points into two problem statements.
The first problem statement relates to the coordination of inspections and logistical aspects of their planning.

<p>
The second problem statement relates to the procurement of the necessary equipment and coordination with inspectors in neighbouring areas to ensure proper coverage.
</p>

<p>
We will now start focusing on these two problem statements, starting with problem #1. As we focus on these problem statements, we will not only help inspectors do their jobs more efficiently, but we will also help district inspectors and regional and district managers streamline their work processes. Because these two problem statements are closely related, it will also give us a better chance of tackling them more easily.
</p>

<p>
To finish, we want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their time and support to help us get to where we are today!
