<p><strong>Rebecca Fiebrink</strong> is a Reader at the Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts London. Her students and research assistants work on a variety of projects developing new technologies to enable new forms of human expression, creativity, and embodied interaction. Much of her current research combines techniques from human-computer interaction, machine learning, and signal processing to allow people to apply machine learning more effectively to new problems, such as the design of new digital musical instruments and gestural interfaces for gaming and accessibility. She is also involved in projects developing rich interactive technologies for digital humanities scholarship, and machine learning education.</p>
